# TasteBuds

## Description
Have you and your friends ever had a hard time agreeing on a place to eat? Or how about a time when you were craving a particular cuisine, but did not know where to find it? Well, TasteBuds is the app for you! It makes locating restaurants easier and also allows you to search by dietary preferences because everyone deserves to eat delicious foods.

On the home page, users are welcomed by a carousel of pictures, an introduction to what Taste Buds is about, and a list of recommended restaurants based on their friend's tastes.

Users are able to search for restaurants based on location and cuisine and further filter the results by dietary preferences or meal times. From the list of restaurants, users can decide if they want to add or remove the restaurant from their profile. Furthermore, if the user has friends, they will be able to see if their friends have also favorited the same restaurant. If there are friends that have liked the same restaurant, then the user will see the friend's name and can click on the friend's profile to see all their favorited restaurants.

On the user's profile, they will see their account information, friends, and a list of recommended restaurants based on their friend's tastes.

Taste Buds eases the burden off users in trying to appease everyone's tastes when trying to decide on a group outing, while also giving users flexibility to be social when they want to be or have a fun outing by themselves.
